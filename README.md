A utility to spawn fresh Gradle/Scala projects

- scala 2.12.8
- gradle wrapper 5.4.1
- dockerfile
- scalatest
- log4j2

### How to use

1. Clone this project into a directory of your choosing.
2. Run the starter script and respond to the prompts:
```sh
./starter-cli/starter.sh
```
The starter will bootstrap a fresh project in a new local directory.

3. Liftoff ðŸš€


### Building

The starter script runs a few `./gradlew` tasks as the last step in the setup. Additional builds, testing, and 
bundling can be had by running the following `./gradlew` tasks:
```
# Run tests
./gradlew clean test

# Bundle the project
./gradlew clean shadowjar

# Run the project
./gradlew clean run
```

### IDE Tips 

If using IntelliJ IDEA:
* close any existing projects to arrive at the "Welcome" menu
* select "Import Project"
* select your local project directory
* choose "Import project from external model", with Gradle as the model option
* choose "Use default gradle wrapper" and press "Finish"

### Build Docker Image
```
# Build the bundled jar
./gradlew clean shadowJar

# Build the docker image and tag it with your project name (e.g. myproject)
docker build -t myproject .

# Run the docker image
docker run myproject:latest
```
