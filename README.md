### Building

The starter script runs a few `./gradlew` tasks as the last step in the setup. Additional builds, testing, and 
bundling can be had by running the following `./gradlew` tasks:
```
# Run tests
./gradlew clean test

# Bundle the project
./gradlew clean shadowjar

# Run the project
./gradlew clean run
```

### Build Docker Image
```
# Build the bundled jar
./gradlew clean shadowJar

# Build the docker image and tag it with your project name (e.g. myproject)
docker build -t myproject .

# Run the docker image
docker run myproject:latest
```
